Set in 1960 New York City, Tom Ripley is a struggling pianist who supplements his income through petty scams. His life takes a pivotal turn when he is mistaken for a Princeton graduate at a high-society event. This chance encounter introduces him to Herbert Greenleaf, a wealthy shipbuilder seeking someone to persuade his son, Dickie, to return from Italy. Seeing an opportunity, Tom accepts the offer and travels to the picturesque town of Atrani. There, he meets Dickie and his girlfriend, Marge Sherwood, who are immersed in a bohemian lifestyle. Tom becomes enamored with their carefree existence and begins to insinuate himself into their lives.
Tom confesses his mission to Dickie, who, intrigued by Tom's audacity, invites him to stay at his villa. The trio enjoys the Italian summer, with Tom and Dickie forming a close bond. However, the arrival of Freddie Miles, Dickie's flamboyant friend, introduces tension. Freddie is suspicious of Tom's intentions and warns Dickie. As Christmas approaches, Dickie and Marge plan a skiing trip to Cortina, subtly excluding Tom. Feeling marginalized, Tom's obsession with Dickie intensifies.
Tom receives a letter from Herbert Greenleaf, terminating his assignment. Simultaneously, Dickie is cautioned about Tom's dubious past. In an attempt to salvage their relationship, Dickie invites Tom on a trip to Sanremo. While sailing, a confrontation ensues, culminating in Tom bludgeoning Dickie to death with an oar. He disposes of the body and decides to assume Dickie's identity, marking the beginning of his descent into a web of lies.
Returning to Atrani, Tom informs Marge that Dickie has gone to Rome. He liquidates Dickie's assets and relocates to Rome, where he forges documents to solidify his new identity. Embracing the privileges of Dickie's life, Tom revels in the luxury and status it affords him.
Tom's charade faces challenges when Freddie visits Rome unexpectedly. Observing inconsistencies, Freddie realizes Tom's deception. In a desperate move, Tom murders Freddie and stages it as a robbery. The police launch an investigation, with Inspector Pietro Ravini leading the case. As suspicion mounts, Tom meticulously covers his tracks, but the pressure begins to take its toll.
The discovery of Freddie's body and the damaged boat intensify the investigation. Marge grows increasingly suspicious of Dickie's prolonged absence and Tom's evasiveness. She confronts Tom in Rome, but he maintains his facade, suggesting Dickie is traveling. Feeling the noose tightening, Tom flees to Palermo, adopting another alias.
Inspector Ravini's investigation uncovers discrepancies in Dickie's financial transactions and Tom's background. He suspects Tom's involvement in both Dickie's and Freddie's disappearances. Meanwhile, Tom continues to manipulate those around him, forging letters and maintaining the illusion of Dickie's existence. The psychological strain of his actions begins to manifest, leading to paranoia and erratic behavior.
In Venice, Tom integrates into high society, attending lavish parties and forming new connections. Marge arrives, still seeking answers about Dickie. Her persistence threatens to unravel Tom's carefully constructed lies. Herbert Greenleaf also arrives, accepting the narrative that Dickie, despondent over his failures and Freddie's death, committed suicide. Tom, now wealthy from Dickie's inheritance, plans his next move. However, a photograph in Marge's book reveals the real Dickie, prompting Inspector Ravini to reopen the case. The series concludes with Tom contemplating his future, haunted by his past deeds but unrepentant, embodying the amorality that defines his character.
